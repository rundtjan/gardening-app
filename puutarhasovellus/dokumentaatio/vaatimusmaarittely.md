# Requirements specification  
## Application description  
With this gardening application it is possible to store information 
concerning when plants are planted, how many seeds are used, and how big 
the yield is. One can also store general information about the spot 
where the plants are grown.  
## Users  
There will be normal users ("gardeners") and admin-users.  
## UI  
There will be at least 5 user interfaces:  
- registration  
- login  
- overview of own information  
- view for adding or editing information 
- admin-view for adding data to dropdown-menus 
## Application functions  
### Before login  
- the user can register for an account
- the user can login
### Functions in production mode at the moment
- the user can register for an account
